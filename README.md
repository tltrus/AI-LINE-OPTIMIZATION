# AI-LINE-OPTIMIZATION

The objective of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in applying artificial intelligence to solve problems related to the optimal distribution of welding points among robots on an **improvised automated line**, with the aim of minimizing the line cycle time and reducing equipment wear.

**AI DeepSeek + C# App generation.**

In path **Line-optimization-1/_FILES** there is a presentation with project description and DeepSeek prompt.
